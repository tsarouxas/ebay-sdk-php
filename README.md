This eBay SDK makes it easy for you to use [eBay API](https://developer.ebay.com/docs) in your PHP-based project.

This repository is not a hobby or a side-project, but a code maintained by a for-profit company that uses it in production. We promise to keep it open-source and maintain it for as long as we operate.

# About this repository

This repository is a fork of another 2 repositories [GeekSeller.com](https://github.com/geekseller/ebay-sdk-php/) [eBay SDK repository](https://github.com/davidtsadler/ebay-sdk-php/). The original code has been developed by [David T. Sadler](https://github.com/davidtsadler), however, in February 2020, David archived the project and decided not to continue maintaining it. GeekSeller uses Davidâ€™s SDK in the production, so we decided to create a fork of this SDK, maintain it as a separate project and offer it to the community. Please note that GeekSeller is part of the eBay Developer Program and we have our eBay application listed in the [eBay Solution Directory](https://cgi6.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?SolutionsDirectory&page=details&solutionId=705084376), however, this SDK is not endorsed, sponsored or maintained by eBay.
Continuing with a fork from virgileb's repo and maintaining it on our end.

## Requirements

  - PHP 5.5 or greater with the following extensions:
      - cURL
      - libxml
  - 64 bit version of PHP recommended as there are some [issues when using the SDK with 32 bit](http://devbay.net/sdk/guides/getting-started/requirements.html#using-the-sdk-with-32-bit-systems).
  - SSL enabled on the cURL extension so that https requests can be made.
